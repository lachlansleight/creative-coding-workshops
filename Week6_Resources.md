# Week 6

### Resources

  * [GDC - Math for Game Programmers: Fast and Funky 1D Nonlinear Tranasformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr5xkf6zSzk) - This was on the list last week, but it becomes even more relevant now that we are actually talking about time-domains
  * [Giving Personality to Procedural Animations using Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPoeNZZ6H4s) - A great video about general-purpose smoothing and damping functions. It's very math heavy (I definitely don't understand all the math myself!!), so don't worry too much about understanding the equations and their derivations. But it's worth watching as a way of thinking about procedural motions.
  * [Procedural Animation: Tail, Wings, Hair, Tentacles! (Unity Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hTnlp9_wX8) - A nice video about creating creatures based on body-segments in 2D using procedural animation. If anyone played that old flash game flOw (are any of you old enough to have even played flash games? I have no idea how out-of-touch I am), this is the method that drove that game's procedural creatures' movements.

### Handy Tools from This Week

  * [Vector3.Lerp](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Lerp.html) - We spoke about this in the context of interpolating between two points, but in the context of procedural animation, we can interpolate from an object's current position (or scale) to a target position (or scale) to smoothly animate! `Quaternion.Lerp` does a similar thing for rotations.
  * [Vector3.MoveTowards](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.MoveTowards.html) - Does exactly what it sounds like - given an input position and a target position, returns a new position that is closer to the target, using a provided maximum speed. Very useful when you want more control over the speed of an object's movement - but can start/stop a little abruptly.
  * [Vector3.SmoothDamp](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.SmoothDamp.html) - Kind of like `Vector3.MoveTowards`, but is a little more complex to use, and looks much nicer. Includes a nice, smooth acceleration and deceleration. You can also use `Mathf.SmoothDamp` to do the same thing with float values. Note that if your float value is an angle, you should use `Mathf.SmoothDampAngle`, since that will wrap nicely around from 359° to 0°.
  * [Quaternion.LookRotation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.LookRotation.html) - Quaternions are pretty hard to work with directly - but it's very common that what you really care about is which *direction* an object is facing. This function turns that concept of a 'facing direction' into a Quaternion that can be used with various interpolation and animation functions. The second parameter is the up direction, which can be useful to prevent spinning - try tilting your head left to right: you're still looking in the same direction, but your overall head rotation is changing, because the 'up vector' for your head is changing!
