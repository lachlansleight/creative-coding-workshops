# Week 2

### Creative Coding Resources

  * [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague) - just everything he does. He is the GOAT of Unity creative-coding video content.
  * [Pezza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFR-QlAx0qFHN9-QmcrpHnQ) - not Unity, but good video content illustrating how you can start with an idea, add some features, and continue adding features based on where your inspiration leads!
  * [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/) - the all-time classic online book for creative coding. Everything is in Processing and 2D, but the philosophies and ideas of the book are universal. Try converting pieces of it to 3D in Unity! Also, I suggest learning processing just as some general life advice, it's easy to get started and I use it regularly to test out algorithm ideas since it's so much easier to go from idea to code without having to create a whole Unity project. Processing is built on Java, but basic Java and basic C# are virtually identical.


### C# Resources

If you feel like your C# could use some work, I strongly recommend working through [this YouTube playlist by Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4CtEelGPsmPzlvP7ISPYzR). We don't really have time in-class for me to take everybody through the absolute basics, so I'm going to assume that over the next two to three weeks that everyone either already knows everything in this, or has completed this tutorial series.

### Handy Tools from This Week

  * [The Random class](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Random.html) - `Random.insideUnitCircle`, `Random.Range`, `Random.rotation`, etc.
  * [Perlin Noise](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.PerlinNoise.html) - incredibly powerful way of making randomness with some level of order
  * [GameObject.CreatePrimitive](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.CreatePrimitive.html) - quickly prototype procedurally-generated geometries using Unity's built-in meshes
  * Inspector attributes
    * [Range](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RangeAttribute.html) - create sliders
    * [Header](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/HeaderAttribute.html) - create headers
    * [Tooltip](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TooltipAttribute.html) - create tooltips
    * [Space](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SpaceAttribute.html) - create spacing
