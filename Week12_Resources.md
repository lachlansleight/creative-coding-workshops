# Week 12

## Text Completion (GPT-3)

### Resources

  * [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) - Where to actually sign up and login to OpenAI so that you can get access to GPT-3. Note that it's not free, but the free tier is enough to get you started (and it's very inexpensive if you're using it creatively rather than at-scale)

  * [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction) - The actual docs page for GPT-3. Anything that you want to know can be found here!

### Tutorials

  * [Prompt Engineering](https://docs.cohere.ai/prompt-engineering-wiki/) - High level overview of what a prompt is and how it works. Provides some useful examples on how to get started that demonstrate the basic ideas
  * [GPT-3 Parameters and Prompt Design](https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt-3-parameters-and-prompt-design-1a595dc5b405) - A more technical tutorial explaining what the specific parameters within GPT-3 do and how to use them to get better results.
  * [Writing stories with an AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fWK0k7aSRs) - A video explaining some high-level approaches to writing fiction with GPT-3. Also demonstrates how to use the GPT-3 playground.

## Text to Image (MidJourney, Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, etc)

### Models

  * [Stable Diffusion Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) - A nice little website that allows you to try out Stable Diffusion for free in the browser. You can use DreamStudio if you want the 'full' experience, but it's paid.
  * [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) - OpenAI's Dall-E. The free tier lets you do 50 images, then it becomes kind of expensive (almost $1 per set of images!)
  * [MidJourney](https://midjourney.com/) - MidJourney, another quite nice image generator. This one you have to use Discord to interact with. Has a pretty generous free tier, and then a monthly subscription (which is nice as it allows you to experiment with prompts without having to pay for each crappy result individually)

  ### Resources + Tutorials
  * [Lexica](https://lexica.art/) - A huge repository of example images created with StableDiffusion with their included prompts. Great for getting a feel for what's possible.
  * [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Prompt Design for Text-to-Image Generative Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-prompt-design-for-text-to-image-generative-models-8242e1361580) - High-level overview of how you can approach designing prompts for these text-to-image systems, along with some nice examples.
  * [Open Library of Artist Styles by MJ Community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cm6239gw1XvvDMRtazV6txa9pnejpKkM5z24wRhhFz0/edit#gid=438712621) - If you're after a particular 'vibe', you can find an artist who's style you like and ask the system to replicate their style. What a lovely capitalist utopia we live in. This was produced for MidJourney, so results may vary when using these artist names with other systems (depending on how famous they are)
  * [Dall-E 2 Art: Experiments with Prompts or How I Got My New Wallpaper](https://strikingloo.github.io/DALL-E-2-prompt-guide) - a nice write-up exploring various prompts and the effects of changes. Has many examples. The same site has a follow-up post (linked in this post) that goes into Stable Diffusion and how it compares to Dall-E 2, which is also very interesting.
  * [Stable Diffusion Resources](https://stackdiary.com/stable-diffusion-resources/) - A nice page with even more resources. Most notable is the included guide on installing and running StableDiffusion locally, so that you can generate unlimited images without having to worry about paying anything! :D
